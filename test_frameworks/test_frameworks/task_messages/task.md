<h2>Task: compound error messages</h2>

<p>To solidify what you have learned, implement a check by yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are given a function&nbsp;<samp><code><strong>test_input_text</strong></code></samp>,&nbsp;which takes two values:&nbsp;<strong>expected_result</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; the expected result, and&nbsp;<strong>actual_result</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; the actual result. Notice that you <strong>don't</strong> need to use <em>input</em>!</p>

<p>The function needs to check that the values match with the help of the&nbsp;<strong>assert</strong>&nbsp;operator and, in the case of a mismatch, provide a comprehensive error message.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Important!</strong> The format of the error should exactly match that in the example so that the checking system accepts it!&nbsp;</p>

<p> You don't need to handle the situation with empty or invalid input.&nbsp;</p>

Sample Input 1:

8 11

Sample Output 1:

expected 8, got 11
