<h2> Multi-class selector </h2>

The page structure has changed a little again: 
<a> https://suninjuly.github.io/css-tasks/multi-class </a>.
Choose a selector for the first text paragraph in the card with the watermelon cat (the last card).
The text that has to become blue is "Watermelon story".
Be attentive and choose a unique selector so that only a single element would 
turn blue.
