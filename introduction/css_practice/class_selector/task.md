<h2> Class selector </h2>
Open this page: <a> https://suninjuly.github.io/css-tasks/class </a>.
Choose a selector for the page subtitle text (the element with the text: "If there's one thing that the internet was made for, it's funny cat memes.")
You can do that in several ways, but try using the element class. Be careful and choose 
a unique selector so that it would identify exactly one element.
