<h2>ID selectors</h2>

<p>CSS selectors are used by frontend developers to select page elements and apply certain styles, i.e., styling rules, to them.&nbsp;
In autotests, we use the same rules to write selectors to find the necessary elements and work with them with Selenium WebDriver.</p>

Open the page https://suninjuly.github.io/css-tasks/practice-id and choose a selector for the heading "Polite cat". 
Use the element ID.
