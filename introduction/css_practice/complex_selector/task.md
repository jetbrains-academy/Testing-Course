<h2>Complex selector </h2>
Open the page <a> https://suninjuly.github.io/css-tasks/complex </a>.
Choose a selector for the description of the second card – the one with a cat and a banana  (the element with the text: "Cat doesn't like bananas!").
Be careful and choose a unique selector so that it would identify exactly one element.
