## About the course

We are happy to welcome you to our course. 
We means Julia Liakh and Lesha Pogibelev, formerly – the testing team on Stepik.org. 
This course is an Edu Tools adapted translation of materials from an open Russian-language course available at https://stepik.org/course/575/promo.

In this course, we tried to offer the minimum a manual tester needs 
to start automating tests with the help of the Python language. 

Here you will learn: 

<ul>
<li> Writing simple scripts to interact with the browser. </li>
<li> Finding all kinds of elements in web pages. </li>
<li> Working with warnings and various autotest windows. </li>
<li> Setting expectations for various element searches. </li>
<li> Working with the version control system Git (on a basic level). </li>
<li> Using different testing frameworks. </li>
<li> Organizing your autotest code so that it could be easily read and supported. </li>
<li> ... and many other things – tips and tricks, as well as practices that we try to follow ourselves! </li>
</ul>

The course contains theory texts and links to additional materials, but it  
is primarily practice-oriented, and the practical tasks are its major value.
You will write lots of code lines, analyze numerous tricky situations, and catch all kinds of hidden bugs. 
Besides, by the end of the course, you will have completed a small testing project –   
the final course assignment. 
You can add this project to your resume to demonstrate your skills to your prospective employer.
