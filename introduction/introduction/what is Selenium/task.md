## What is Selenium?
This term might mean different things in different contexts. 

Let's figure it all out! 

First: Selenium is a project designed for web application testing automation.
It's an open-source project, which means that its source code is open.
At any moment, one can look inside the code and see how this or that method works under the hood.
You can also come up with your own ideas, contact the project developers, and 
make a pull request to fix or improve the code.

It's a complex, umbrella project consisting of a number of diverse components. For example: 

<ul>
<li> Selenium WebDriver </li>
<li> Selenium Grid </li>
<li> Selenium Server </li>
<li> Selenium IDE </li>
</ul>
and others.

Besides, the project contains a number of specific browser drivers and client libraries for various programming languages.

In most cases, it's clear from the context what part of Selenium is referred to.
In this course, we'll talk about Selenium WebDriver, and each time we mention Selenium,
we will mean that particular part of the project. What it is about, we'll discuss in more detail in the next section.
