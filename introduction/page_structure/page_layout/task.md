## Task: coding a web page
In this task, you will describe several elements in order to 
better grasp the structure of HTML pages. For a short while, 
step into frontend developer's shoes! 

Try to design a simple page devoted to your pet or any other animal – a page 
you would like to share with the world.


1. Open the file `index.html`.
2. Right under the heading, find the element with the tag "img". It is the element that will display a picture. Add the class attribute with the value "picture" to it. Add a value to the existing attribute "src": insert the image link in quotes.
3. Right under the image element, find the division element with the tag "div". In this block, we'll have the pet's name and description. Add an attribute "name" with the value "about" to it.
4. Add a descendant to that element. It will be a heading – add an element with the "h3" tag. Don't forget to use the opening and closing tags. Add an "id" attribute with the value "pet-name". Inside the tag, write the pet's name or the species of the animal.
5. Add another descendant of the "div" element, now it will be a text, so use the "p" tag. Add a data-type attribute with the value "description" to it. Inside the tag, write a few words about your pet. Notice that the data-type attribute is a custom one – we've made it up.
