<h2>Task:&nbsp;using the find_element<strong>s</strong> method</h2>

<p>In this task, you need to fill in a form (<a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/huge_form.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: http://suninjuly.github.io/huge_form.html">http://suninjuly.github.io/huge_form.html</a>).&nbsp;It was designed to help the marketing department of the company N collect detailed information about their product users. The reward for filling in the form is a discount coupon. However, the marketing people have obviously outdone themselves having added 100 compulsory fields to the form and having limited the time given to complete the form. Now, only bots can handle the task. ﻿🤖﻿.</p>

<p>Use WebDriver, the <strong>find_elements</strong> method, the necessary locator and its values.</p>

<p>Use the template below: in the "for" cycle, we can sequentially take each element from the list of found text fields and send an arbitrary text to each field. If the script fails to fill in the form in time, choose a shorter text.&nbsp;</p>
