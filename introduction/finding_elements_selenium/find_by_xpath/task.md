<h2>Task: find an element by XPath</h2>

<p>In this case, we'll use the option of finding elements by XPath.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the web page <a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/find_xpath_form" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">http://suninjuly.github.io/find_xpath_form</a>, you will find the same registration form as in step 3, but now it has a bunch of identical submission buttons. However, the only one that works is the button with the text &quot;Submit&quot;, and our task is to click it in our code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your steps:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Choose a unique XPath selector so that it will find <em>only</em> the button with the text <strong>Submit</strong>. You can formulate XPath any way you like (by text, structure, or attributes), just make it work.</li>
	<li>Modify the code from step 3 so that it will use button search by XPath.</li>
	<li>Run the code.</li>
</ol>
