<h2><strong>Task: search of descendant</strong></h2>

<p>Open the page <a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/cats.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://suninjuly.github.io/cats.html</a>. Open the developer console, the Elements tab. Write a <strong>minimal</strong> sufficient CSS selector that will find the serious cat picture (Serious cat). For finding the appropriate element in the picture folder, use the parent element <strong>div.col-sm-4 </strong> together with the pseudo-class <strong>&nbsp;:nth-child(n)</strong> to choose the n-th element, as well as the picture selector based on the <strong>img</strong> tag. When writing the selector, don't use the <strong>&gt;</strong> symbol, as this is a task of finding a descendant without using child elements. To solve it, the above-mentioned selectors must be enough.</p>

<p>Please do not use selectors generated by the browser when clicking the "Copy CSS selector" button or by extensions. They often build the whole path starting from the <strong>body</strong>, and that is a very unstable selector; writing such selectors in your code is a bad practice. In case of a slightest modification in the page structure, all your selectors will lose relevance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not use square brackets – constructions like <em>[class=&quot;stepic&quot;].</em></p>

<p>Enter the chosen selector as the answer to this task.</p>
