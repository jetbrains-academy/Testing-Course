<h2><strong>Task: choosing selectors 3</strong></h2> 

Lenin cat is still hiding.
Again, mark only those unique selectors that allow you to find an element 
containing the text "Lenin cat" on the page http://suninjuly.github.io/cats.html. 
Now the set of correct and incorrect selectors has changed.

Note: If the selector finds multiple elements, it is not suitable as an answer to this task.
