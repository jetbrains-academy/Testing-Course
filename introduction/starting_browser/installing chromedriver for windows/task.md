## Installing the driver for the browser: Windows

To install the driver, open the site https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ 
and download the version of ChromeDriver
matching the version of your browser.
To find out the browser version, open a new window in Chrome,
type chrome://version/ in the search box and press Enter.
In the top line, you'll see the information on your browser version.

Unarchive the downloaded file.
On disc C:, create a folder `chromedriver` and put the unarchived file chromedriver.exe in the folder `C:\chromedriver`.
Add the `C:\chromedriver` folder to the system variable PATH. 
The ways of doing that in different Windows versions
are described here: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm. 

After the installation, proceed to `[step](course://introduction/starting_browser/starting_browser)`.
