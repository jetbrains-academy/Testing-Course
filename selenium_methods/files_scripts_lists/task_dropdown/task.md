<h2>Task: working with dropdown lists</h2>

<p>For this task, we came up with another version of a captcha test. We'll need to slightly retrain our robot so that it can handle the task.</p>

<p>Write code that realizes the following scenario:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the page <a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/selects1.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: http://suninjuly.github.io/selects1.html">https://suninjuly.github.io/selects1.html</a>.</li>
	<li>Calculate the sum of the given numbers.</li>
	<li>In the dropdown list, choose the value corresponding to the calculated sum.</li>
	<li>Press the "Submit" button.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do everything correctly and fast enough (there's a time limit in this task, too), you will see a window with a number. Submit this number as an answer for the task.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When you see that your code works, try running it on the page <a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/selects2.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://suninjuly.github.io/selects2.html</a>. It should run successfully there, too.</p>

<p>Hint: <span style="color: #ffffff;">if you get an error of the kind "argument of type 'int' is not iterable", check the type of the variable that you pass to the search function. It should be a string!</span></p>
