<h2>Task: execute_script</h2>

<p>In this task, you will once again need to pass the captcha test and handle the huge horrible footer, which the designer hasn't fixed yet. You'll need to write code to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the page <a href="http://SunInJuly.github.io/execute_script.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://SunInJuly.github.io/execute_script.html</a>.</li>
	<li>Read the value for the variable x.</li>
	<li>Execute a mathematical function of x.</li>
	<li>Scroll the page down.</li>
	<li>Enter the answer into the text field.</li>
	<li>Select the checkbox "I'm a robot".</li>
	<li>Switch the radio button "Robots rule!".</li>
	<li>Click the "Submit" button.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do everything correctly and fast enough (there's a time limit in this task, too), you will see a window with a number. Submit this number as an answer for the task.</p>

<p>In this task, you will need to use the execute_script method in order to scroll the page to the visibility area of the elements overlapped by the footer.</p>
