<h2>Task: treasure hunt with get_attribute</h2>

<p>In this task, with the help of a robot, you need to solve the same mathematical problem as in the previous task. However, now the value of the <strong>х</strong> variable is hidden in a "chest", i.e., in the <strong>valuex</strong> attribute of the chest image.</p>

<p>Your program needs to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the page <a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/get_attribute.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://suninjuly.github.io/get_attribute.html</a>.</li>
	<li>On the page, find the element – an image of a chest with a treasure.</li>
	<li>Get the value of the <strong>valuex</strong> attribute of this element, which is the x value for the task.</li>
	<li>Calculate the mathematical function of x (the function itself does not change).</li>
	<li>Enter the answer in the text field.</li>
	<li>Mark the checkbox "I'm a robot".</li>
	<li>Select the radiobutton "Robots rule!".</li>
	<li>Press the "Submit" button.</li>
</ol>

<p>To calculate the value of the expression in (4), use the calc(x) function from the previous task.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you've done everything right and quickly enough (this task also has a time limit), you'll see a window with a number. Copy it to the field below and press the "Submit" button to receive points for the task.</p>
