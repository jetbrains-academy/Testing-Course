<h2>Task: switching to a new tab</h2>

<p>In this task, after you click the button, a page will open in a new tab. You need to switch WebDriver to the new tab and solve a problem there.</p>

<p>The implementation scenario is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the page <a href="http://suninjuly.github.io/redirect_accept.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: http://suninjuly.github.io/redirect_accept.html">http://suninjuly.github.io/redirect_accept.html</a>.</li>
	<li>Click the button.</li>
	<li>Switch to the new tab.</li>
	<li>Solve the captcha test and get the answer number.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do everything correctly and fast enough (there's a time limit in this task, too), you will see a window with a number. Submit this number as an answer for the task.</p>
