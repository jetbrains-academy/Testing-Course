## Thank you!

Our course is coming to an end! Thank you for being with us until the victorious end. 
We put in a lot of effort to make sure everything was clear and interesting for everyone :)

We would really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to answer our [survey](
https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/course-feedback-automated-ui).
Your feedback will help us improve this course and make it relevant for future students.

We hope that after completing this course, 
automation testing with Selenium won't be intimidating anymore, 
and you'll be able to start writing real automated tests. 
In this course, we aimed to cover the fundamental approaches and tools for
creating a project with automated tests.
Start by writing simple test scripts that verify the most critical scenarios
in your web application.
You can manually run these tests before releases to quickly gather information about the
product's state.
Once your automated tests start finding the first bugs,
you'll realize that your time spent on this course was worthwhile.

For further development as an automation QA, 
you'll need to explore the following important topics:

- Running tests on remote servers using Selenium Grid, Selenoid, or similar tools. This allows for automatic test execution, faster test runs, and facilitates cross-browser and cross-platform testing.
- Basic knowledge of Docker technology to manage containers with browsers on remote servers. There are ready-made containers available for use in Selenium Grid: https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium.
- Configuring a Continuous Integration server to build the continuous integration process. Tests should be automatically triggered on a schedule or for each commit.
- Configuring test result reports with detailed information about errors, enabling quicker localization of bugs found by automated tests. You can use the pytest-html plugin for PyTest or the Allure framework.
- Generating screenshots and videos in case of test failures to simplify analysis and problem reproduction. Some tools already support this feature, such as pytest-splinter.
- Preparing test data using database queries or API calls.


These topics deserve a separate extensive course. 
They are premature for a Junior Automation Tester, so we didn't include them in this course, but now you are skilled enough to continue this journey on your own.
